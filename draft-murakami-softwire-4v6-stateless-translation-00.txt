                      4via6 Stateless Translation
               draft-murakami-softwire-4v6-translation-00

Abstract

   Regarding IPv4 connectivity across IPv6-only network, IPv4 packets
   are encapsulated in IPv6 to cross a segment of IPv6-only network.  In
   some particular network scenarios (i.e., wireless network), its
   bandwidth is very valuable and scarce resource.  Operators in such a
   network usually hope to decrease the overhead as much as possible for
   saving the bandwidth in such a environment.  Key aspects include
   stateless operations with the algorithmic mapping between IPv4
   addresses and IPv6 addresses.

1.  Introduction

   During the transition period from only IPv4 to IPv6, service
   provider's (SP's) infrastructure network will deploy IPv6.  However
   service provider has not only to offer IPv6 connectivity but also to
   maintain a residual IPv4 connectivity for outgoing and incoming
   connections.  For providing IPv4 connectivity across IPv6 network,
   4rd [I-D.murakami-softwire-4rd] is a stateless solution to allow end-
   users in IPv4 network to communicate servers located in IPv4 Internet
   across IPv6 network by encapsulating the packets in IPv6.

   However, this solution is using IPv6 encapsulating mechanism in order
   to communicate IPv4 islands across IPv6 network.  Hence, the
   additional IPv6 header is required and the size of the packet is
   increasing.  If the network has the limited bandwidth like a wireless
   network, operators are unwilling to use this solution because the
   additional header might not be preferable.  Meanwhile, the stateless
   NAT64 is proposed such as [RFC6052] and [RFC6145].

   This solution is using the same algorithmic address mapping rule
   between IPv4 addresses and IPv6 addresses defined in
   [I-D.murakami-softwire-4rd] but using the stateless address
   translation to forward IPv4 packets across IPv6 network similar to
   the stateless NAT64 defined in [RFC6052] and [RFC6145] in stead of
   IPv6 encapsulation using in [I-D.murakami-softwire-4rd]


2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Terminology

   4via6 domain (Domain):  A set of 4via6 CEs and BRs connected to the
                         same virtual link.  A service provider may
                         deploy 4via6 with a single 4via6 domain, or may
                         utilize multiple 4via6 domains.  Each domain
                         requires a separate 4via6 prefix.

   4via6 Border Relay (BR):  A 4via6-enabled router managed by the
                         service provider at the edge of a 4via6 domain.
                         A Border Relay router has at least an IPv6-
                         enabled interface and an IPv4 interface
                         connected to the native IPv4 network.  A 4via6
                         BR may also be referred to simply as a "BR"

                         within the context of 4via6.

   4via6 Customer Edge (CE):  A device functioning as a Customer Edge
                         router in a 4via6 deployment.  In a residential
                         broadband deployment, this type of device is
                         sometimes referred to as a "Residential
                         Gateway" (RG) or "Customer Premises Equipment"
                         (CPE).  A typical 4via6 CE adopting 4rd rules
                         will serve a residential site with one WAN side
                         interface, one or more LAN side interfaces.  A
                         4via6 CE may also be referred to simply as a
                         "CE" within the context of 4via6.

   Shared IPv4 address:  An IPv4 address that is shared among multiple
                         nodes.  Each node has a separate part of the
                         transport layer port space.


4.  4via6 Translation Framework

   Figure 1 depicts the overall architecture with IPv4 users networks
   connected through routed IPv6 networks.  Therein, IPv4 users are
   connected to IPv6 network via CPE with 4via6 translation modules.
